Learnable Image Encryption
---

## Abstract
The network-based machine learning algorithm is very powerful tools. However, it requires huge training dataset. Researchers often meet privacy issues when they collect image dataset especially for surveillance applications. A learnable image encryption scheme is introduced. The key idea of this scheme is to encrypt images, so that human cannot understand images but the network can be train with encrypted images. This scheme allows us to train the network without the privacy issues. In this paper, a simple learnable image encryption algorithm is proposed. Then, the proposed algorithm is validated with cifar dataset.
